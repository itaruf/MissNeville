1. The Dialog system: Provides scripted interactions between characters, enriching the story while guiding the player. They can be triggered when the player waks a certain area, talks to a NPC or complete a puzzle.
<br>
2. The Event system: throughout the game, events are triggered to enhance/advance the narrative or gameplay experience. Like above, they can be triggered through different ways.

3. The map system: Each room is connected to another, but can/can't be accessible depending on the player's current progression in the story.
<br>
4. The inventory system: The player can navigate through their inventory which currently has 2 items. They can also read the items' description by selecting them, prompting a chat box to appear on screen.
      
## :zap: Challenges Encountered
- **First (semi) professional project** with deadlines and weekly meetings to attend to.
- **Explain as precisely as possible** what was done, and whatâ€™s planned for the next meeting.
- **Get the hang of the provided API** to start developing the main features as soon as possible.
- **Design an interesting and complex game** with tons of features from scratch, yet deliver the finished product in time.
- **Develop an event system** to have a dynamic game.
- **Managing school time** (as I was enrolled at the time I started this program) and project time.
