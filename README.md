# DevelopAtUbisoft-IVT-2022

## For this edition, here are the changements made:
You can now convert your textures in the API supported format through the script available in ConvertToBmp.
You can vertically flip your UV mapping through the CSimpleSprite object method called SetVerticalFlip() (to allow the users to have a right/left anim when only one direction is provided in the assets pack).
The texture sampling mode is in NEAREST and the texture adress mode is in clamp to improve pixel art rendering when scaled.

## You have to:

Code your game in GameTest.cpp
The functions Init(), Update(), Render() and Shutdown() are your main functions.
Don't hesitate to develop your codes in additional files.

Good luck :)
