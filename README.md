<h4>Dialog system</h4>
<ul>

    Provides scripted interactions between characters, enriching the story while guiding the player. They can be triggered when the player waks a certain area, talks to a NPC or complete a puzzle.
  </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Event system</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    throughout the game, events are triggered to enhance/advance the narrative or gameplay experience. Like above, they can be triggered through different ways.
  </li> 
</ul>
<h4>Puzzle system</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  The player progresses by solving puzzles with a consistent mechanism: start, await condition fulfillment, then conclude. Each solved puzzle rewards pages that deepen story understanding.
  </li> 
</ul>

<h4>Collision system</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
   A 2D-square shaped collision with different collision responses: trigger, block, and overlap, that enables versatile interaction with the environment, and triggers to start events.

</ul>

## Challenges Encountered ‚ö°
- **First (semi) professional project** with deadlines and weekly meetings to attend to.
- **Explain as precisely as possible** what was done, and what‚Äôs planned for the next meeting.
- **Get the hang of the provided API** to start developing the main features as soon as possible.
- **Design an interesting and complex game** with tons of features from scratch, yet deliver the finished product in time.
- **Develop an event system** to have a dynamic game.
- **Managing school time** (as I was enrolled at the time I started this program) and project time.
