    <li><h4>Dialog system</h4>

      </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li><h4>Event system</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>throughout the game, events are triggered to enhance/advance the narrative or gameplay experience. Like above, they can be triggered through different ways.
      </li> 
    </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li><h4>Puzzle system</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The player progresses by solving puzzles with a consistent mechanism: start, await condition fulfillment, then conclude. Each solved puzzle rewards pages that deepen story understanding.

### :zap: Challenges encountered
- **First (semi) professional project** with deadlines and weekly meetings to attend to.
- **Explain as precisely as possible** what was done, and what‚Äôs planned for the next meeting.
- **Get the hang of the provided API** to start developing the main features as soon as possible.
- **Design an interesting and complex game** with tons of features from scratch, yet deliver the finished product in time.
- **Develop an event system** to have a dynamic game.
- **Managing school time** (as I was enrolled at the time I started this program) and project time.
